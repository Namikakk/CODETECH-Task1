OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

Project: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
Objective
It is a Python program that implements a basic password strength assessment tool based on the outlined pseudocode. This program checks the length, complexity, and uniqueness of a password entered by the user and provides feedback on its strength

KEY ACTIVITIES

1. Input Handling: Receive and validate the password entered by the user.

2. Length Assessment: Calculate a score based on the length of the password. Longer passwords generally receive higher scores.

3. Complexity Analysis: Evaluate the complexity of the password by checking for:
   
4. Uniqueness Check: Verify if the password has been compromised or is too common by:
   - Checking against known breach databases (e.g., using APIs like Have I Been Pwned)
   - Comparing against a list of common passwords

5. Overall Score Calculation: Combine the scores from length, complexity, and uniqueness checks to compute an overall strength score.

6. Strength Rating Determination: Convert the overall score into a strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong) to provide feedback to the user.

7. Feedback to User: Display the strength rating of the password to the user along with specific suggestions for improvement (if needed).
